# Note-App

## Overview

The Notes Web App is a simple and intuitive application that allows users to create, edit, and delete notes. The notes are saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring that they persist even after a page refresh. This app provides a straightforward user interface for managing personal notes, making it a useful tool for jotting down ideas, reminders, or any other text-based content.

## Features

- **Create Notes:** Easily add new notes using the "Create Notes" button. Each note is represented as a contenteditable paragraph element.
- **Edit Notes:** Modify the content of your notes directly in the browser. Each note supports rich text formatting.
- **Delete Notes:** Remove individual notes by clicking the delete icon associated with each note.
- **Persistent Storage:** Notes are saved in the browser's local storage, allowing them to persist across page reloads and browser sessions.
- **Enter Key Handling:** Custom handling of the Enter key in contenteditable elements to insert line breaks rather than creating new paragraphs.

## How It Works

1. **Loading Notes:** On page load, the app retrieves notes from local storage and displays them in the `notes-container` element.
2. **Adding Notes:** Clicking the "Create Notes" button generates a new note element with an editable `contenteditable` property and a delete icon.
3. **Editing Notes:** Users can directly type into the notes, and changes are automatically saved to local storage.
4. **Deleting Notes:** Clicking the delete icon on a note removes it from the view and updates the local storage.
5. **Saving Changes:** Any changes made to notes (including edits and deletions) are saved to local storage in real-time.
